![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Logo_of_YouTube_%282015-2017%29.svg/1280px-Logo_of_YouTube_%282015-2017%29.svg.png){width=50%}

The YouTube Viewing Habits Survey has been conducted for the purpose of collecting ***categorical*** and ***numerical*** data. This data is used to investigate and gain insight into viewing habits of the authot on **YouTube**, specifically looking into the the type of YouTube videos that is most viewed and the activity done while watching. The data collected was used to produce the following graphs below.

```{r, fig.width=12}
library(tidyverse)

csv_file <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ1Ecx8IHTYpLxm8Q6cjBBmZE88GHlN7t6pN_fgIJz63NhPu2sRb0w22Xk65La7-3cnj39iE2ggPEuL/pub?gid=1008665205&single=true&output=csv"

logged_data <- read_csv(csv_file)

latest_data <- logged_data %>%
  rename(categories = 2,
         video_length = 3,
         engagement_level = 4,
         multitasking = 5,
         activity = 6)

latest_data %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(x = categories, 
                fill = categories)) +
    labs(title = "Which type of YouTube videos are watched the most?",
         subtitle = "Examining the distribution of YouTube videos watched across different categories",
         caption = "Source: Youtube Viewing Habits Survey",
         x = "Video category",
         y = "Number of videos")

# need to display at least two bar charts + dynamic comments based on
# at least two summary values
# can use paste() or paste0() for dynamic comments, or use inline R code

# amount of videos watched
total_videos <- length(latest_data$video_length)
# total amount of hours of youtube videos watched
total_time <- ((sum(latest_data$video_length)) / 60) %>%
  round(1)

average_eng <- mean(latest_data$engagement_level) %>% round(1)

```

According to the survey, there are **`r total_videos`** videos in total that have been watched, giving a total watch time of **`r total_time`** hours.

The average engagement level while watching YouTube videos is **`r average_eng`**, where where 1 is *not engaged at all* and 5 is *fully engaged*.

### The survey was interested in whether the viewer was multitasking and what activity was done.

**Here are the results:**

```{r, fig.width=10}
latest_data %>%  
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(y = activity,
                fill = activity)) +
    labs(title = "Activities done while watching YouTube",
         subtitle = "A look at activites performed while consuming YouTube content",
         caption = "Source: Youtube Viewing Habits Survey",
         x = "Number of videos",
         y = "Activity")

```

The grey bar (NA) shows how many videos were watched fully without multitasking.
